DMP stands for Digital Motion Processing. The MPU 6050 has a built-in motion processor. It processes the values from the accelerometer and gyroscope to give us accurate 3D values. Also, you will need to wait about 10 seconds before you get accurate values from the BeagleBone Black-MPU6050, after which the values will begin to stabilize
