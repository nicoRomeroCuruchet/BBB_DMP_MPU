The MPU6050 is a sensor consisting of three axes of acceleration / three axes of gyro. If a dedicated processor called DMP is used in the MPU6050, the MPU6050 performs sensor fusion processing for obtaining Roll / Pitch / Yaw. Also, you will need to wait about 10 seconds before you get accurate values from the BeagleBoneBlack-MPU6050, after which the values will begin to stabilize.
